# Together
Identities are always a part of us and it's hard to find communities that speak to who we are. It's even harder for minorities to find communities in their schools or workplaces. Our app, Together connects individuals to communities their identities align with. In addition to connecting people to diverse communities, Together connects users to specific organization members and allows them to chat and schedule meetings.
Together can make an ever larger community impact when used by companies! Many businesses have affinity groups their employees can be part of (e.g Black Employee Network (BEN), Amazon Women in Engineering (AWE)). With Together, employees can easily reach out to existing members and feel like they are seen and heard in their workplace.

With Together, we hope to empower underrepresented communities by strengthening their numbers and making communication accessible.
